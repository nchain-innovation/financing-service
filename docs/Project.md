The Rust service uses the [`chain-gang`](https://github.com/nchain-innovation/chain-gang) library for blockchain access (WhatsOnChain, UaaS, a node's JSON-RPC endpoint, or the test interface) and wallet operations. Optionally it broadcasts through [mapi-lite](https://github.com/nchain-innovation/mapi-lite) via that project's `uls-client` crate.

| `main.rs` | Config load, HTTP server, periodic UTXO refresh |
| `rest_api.rs` | REST handlers, auth gates |
| `service.rs` | Orchestration, funding flow, client management |

| `broadcaster/mod.rs` | `TxBroadcaster` seam for sending funding transactions |
| `broadcaster/woc.rs` | Broadcast through the configured `BlockchainInterface` (WoC in production) |

## Implemented

* REST API for funding, balance, address, client management, status, and health
* JSON request/response bodies with typed serde DTOs
* Dynamic client add/remove via `POST /client` and `DELETE /client/{id}`
* Optional per-client `api_key` authentication
* Optional `admin_api_key` for `POST /client`
* Secret references via `env:VAR`, environment overrides, and `wif_env` / `api_key_env` on `POST /client`
* Optional OpenTelemetry trace export via OTLP (configurable, disabled by default)
* Configurable per-IP HTTP rate limiting with `/health` and `/ready` exempt
* Balance checks against total wallet balance; funding combines multiple UTXOs when needed; balance endpoint refreshes from chain on each request; `multiple_tx` partial failures return structured successful transaction data; concurrent fund requests for the same client use read-only planning and commit UTXO updates only after broadcast
* Optional mapi-lite transaction broadcaster (`[mapi_lite]`): broadcasts go to mapi-lite, reads stay on the blockchain interface, `/ready` probes mapi-lite and returns 503 when it is down while `/health` stays up, `/status` names the broadcaster, startup logs the selection
* Docker image with `/health` liveness check
* CI: build, test, `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, `cargo audit`
* `chain-gang` from crates.io at an exact release, with a committed `Cargo.lock`, for reproducible builds
* 144 automated tests (unit, integration, REST API, system requirements)

## Known limitations

* **Multi-tx partial failure** — in `multiple_tx` mode, earlier successful broadcasts remain on-chain if a later step fails. The service resyncs UTXO state and returns HTTP 422 with code `partial_broadcast` and `description`, plus `outpoints` and `txs` for any transactions that were broadcast successfully.
* **No HTTPS** — expected to be handled at the deployment layer (reverse proxy, firewall).
* **Rate limiting behind a reverse proxy** — limits apply to the proxy's IP unless the proxy forwards the original client address and a custom key extractor is added.
* **Same-client concurrent funding** — concurrent requests for one client never spend the same input: each claims its inputs while planning. A request that finds every UTXO already claimed by requests still broadcasting is refused with `funds_in_flight` (HTTP 503, `Retry-After: 1`) until one completes, so a client funded from a single UTXO funds one request at a time; `insufficient_balance` and `no_suitable_utxo` are kept for a wallet that is short however the claims settle. Different clients are not blocked by each other.
