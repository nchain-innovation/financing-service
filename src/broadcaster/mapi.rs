//! Broadcasting through a mapi-lite server, using the `uls-client` crate.
//!
//! mapi-lite is nChain's Rust MerchantAPI surface; `uls-client` is its typed
//! HTTP client and shares the wire types with the server, so this module never
//! spells out JSON. A submit is `POST /mapi/txs` with a one-element batch; the
//! fee rate comes from `GET /mapi/feeQuote`. The health probe is mapi-lite's
//! own `GET /ready` (CS-505), which fails when mapi-lite cannot do its work --
//! nodes unreachable, block ingest behind, or it cannot sign or reach its
//! database. It used to be the fee quote, which mapi-lite answers from its
//! configuration even with every node down.
//!
//! Two `uls-client` clients share one base URL and token: the submit client
//! and the probe client, which asks `GET /ready` (`MapiClient::ready`, read as
//! the shared `ReadyReport`, CS-627) and fetches the fee quote. The probe
//! client has a short timeout and no retries, because `GET /ready` has to
//! answer inside a readiness probe's few seconds however slow mapi-lite is
//! being.
//!
//! **The submit is uls-client's `MapiClient::broadcast` (CS-627).** It reads
//! mapi-lite's verdict on one transaction: one result, for the transaction it
//! hashed; an acceptance mapi-lite could not record resubmitted once; anything
//! it cannot read an unknown outcome. Its retries keep what this service
//! needs structural: [`ClientError::may_have_been_delivered`] tells an attempt
//! that may have reached a node -- cancelled in flight, answered `504`, or
//! unreadable -- from one that cannot have, a refused connection or a `503`,
//! and only the first calls for the funding inputs to be reserved (see
//! `BroadcastError::Indeterminate` and `Client::commit_uncertain_funding_spend`).
//! This module ran that loop itself until uls-client v0.4.0 could say which.
//!
//! The whole broadcast, resubmission included, is bounded by
//! `mapi_lite.total_timeout_seconds`, the one timing setting (CS-624). Each
//! attempt outlasts the submit ceiling mapi-lite publishes in `/ready` by a
//! margin, so a hung node is reported by mapi-lite's `504` rather than this
//! side's timeout, and as many retries run as fit inside the deadline (see
//! `SubmitBudget`). Until mapi-lite has published a ceiling its default is
//! assumed; one it publishes that changes the budget rebuilds the submit
//! client. A funding call is interactive: a wedged mapi-lite must not hold
//! the caller, and the actix worker serving it, for longer than that.
